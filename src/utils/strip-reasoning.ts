/**
 * Separate a model's inline reasoning from its answer.
 *
 * MiniMax M2.5 — the configured default — emits its chain of thought inline as
 * `<think>...</think>` in the message content rather than as a separate
 * reasoning field. Nothing handled it, so a Telegram reply opened with
 * "The user wants me to report the MSFT grading results. Let me extract..."
 * before getting to the answer.
 *
 * The first fix simply deleted it. That is right for a non-thinking surface but
 * wrong in general: on a thinking model the reasoning is worth showing, clearly
 * labelled as thinking rather than as the answer. So this splits rather than
 * strips, and each surface decides what to do with the two halves.
 *
 * Other providers use the same convention with different tags, so the whole
 * family is handled.
